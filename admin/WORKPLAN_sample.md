## Log

### 2025-09-23
- (Behr) ⏳ M1.T2 — Crime data has 35 columns, many unclear (CMPLNT_NUM, KY_CD, OFNS_DESC); found data dictionary

### 2025-09-28
- (Behr) ⏳ M2.T2 — Created temporal features, but location is just text ("CORNER OF 42 ST and 8 AVE")

### 2025-09-30
- (Behr) ⏳ M4.T2 — Logistic regression with just temporal features: 0.31 F1 score, basically random

### 2025-10-05
- (Behr) ⏳ M4.T3 — Random Forest no better (0.33 F1), realizing we need spatial information
- (Team) 🆕 M3.T1, M3.T2, M3.T3 — Added entire geocoding milestone (not in original plan!)

### 2025-10-08
- (Team) ❌ M2.T3 — Abandoned "Create crime severity scores" - focusing on occurrence not severity
- (Team) ❌ M2.T4 — Abandoned "Aggregate by precinct" - too coarse for useful predictions

### 2025-10-12
- (Team) ⏳ M1.T5 — Discovered 60+ crime types including "HARRASSMENT 2" and "PETIT LARCENY", need to filter
- (Team) 🔄 M1.T5 — Pivoted to violent public crimes only (assault, robbery, etc.)

### 2025-10-14
- (Abishek) 🚫 M3.T1 — Google Maps API rate limits (2500/day free tier), need alternative

### 2025-10-15
- (Abishek) ⏳ M3.T1 — Switched to NYC GeoClient API, but it's rejecting 30% of addresses

### 2025-10-17
- (Carmen) 🆕 M2.T7 — Added parsing step to extract cross-streets from freeform text
- (Abishek) ⏳ M3.T1 — Combining NYC GeoClient with OSM Nominatim for better coverage

### 2025-10-22
- (Abishek) ⏳ M3.T3 — Some crimes on block boundaries; assigning to nearest centroid
- (Team) ⏳ M3.T4 — Trying spatial interpolation for missing locations using kernel density

### 2025-10-24
- (Team) ❌ M3.T4 — Abandoned interpolation - introduces too much noise, will just exclude 15% missing

### 2025-10-26
- (Behr) ⏳ M4.T5 — XGBoost grid search: max_depth [3,6,9,12], learning_rate [0.01,0.05,0.1,0.3]
- (Behr) ⏳ M4.T5 — Best params: depth=6, lr=0.1, but F1 still only 0.42

### 2025-10-27
- (Team) 🆕 M5.* — Added entire "Enhanced Data Integration" milestone - need external features!
- (Abishek) 🆕 M3.T5 — Added spatial adjacency matrix task for future spatial models

### 2025-10-30
- (Carmen) 🚫 M5.T1 — NOAA weather API changed, need to register for new key

### 2025-11-01
- (Carmen) ⏳ M5.T1 — Got NOAA access, but data is by weather station not block, need to map
- (Abishek) ⏳ M5.T2 — Census API returns data by tract, need tract-to-block crosswalk file

### 2025-11-02
- (Behr) ⏳ M4.T6 — Trying block embeddings, but sparse data causing overfitting
- (Team) 🆕 M6.* — Added "Advanced Modeling" milestone - simple models insufficient

### 2025-11-03
- (Carmen) ⏳ M5.T1 — Found weather station coordinates, using nearest station for each block
- (Abishek) ⏳ M5.T2 — Downloaded Census ACS 5-year estimates: population density, median age, income

### 2025-11-04
- (Team) ❌ M4.T4 — Abandoned SVM approach (too slow with 50K+ blocks)
- (Behr) 🚫 M4.T6 — Neural network training blocked, need more features first before continuing
